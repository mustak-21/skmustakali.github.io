## Welcome to my homepage!

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), Michigan State University. At FRIB, I work with the Charge-Exchange group led by Prof. Remco Zegers. My current research focuses on investigating charge-exchange reactions to benchmark and improve theoretical models for calculating weak interaction rates that play a key role in astrophysical phenomena, such as supernovae and neutron stars.

More details about my ongoing projects can be found in the [Research](/research/) section.

I pursued my Ph.D. at **Bose Institute, Kolkata** under the supervision of Prof. Dhruba Gupta. My doctoral research involved studying nuclear reactions relevant to the **Cosmological Lithium Problem (CLiP)** â€” one of the major unsolved issues in nuclear astrophysics. This included experimental measurements of reaction cross sections at **ISOLDE, CERN**. I completed my M.Sc. in Physics from Bose Institute and B.Sc. from Scottish Church College, Kolkata.

Beyond academics, I enjoy watching movies, TV series, and cricket. I'm an enthusiastic traveler and foodie â€” and **North Kolkata** holds a special place in my heart. ðŸ˜Š
